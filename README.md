# Hi!

## About me
<p>I'm Braden, and I like making games with LÖVE. I got into text-based programming when I was 13, but it took me a bit to know how to make use of the skill</p>
- My dominant language is Lua, but I know a little Python and hope to learn something like Javascript, or some variant of C </br>
- I like making music and art </br>

## Projects
I'm not working on a lot right now, but here are some I'm publicly working on: </br>

- [UNDERLÖVE](https://github.com/bradensMG/underlove) -- an UNDERTALE battle framework developed by me
