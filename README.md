# Hi

## About me
<p>I'm Braden, and I like making games with LÖVE</p>
- My dominant language is Lua, but I hope to get into software development with Java, Javascript, and Python </br>
- I like making music and art </br>
<p>I got into text-based programming when I was 13, but it took me a bit to know how to make use of the skill</p>

## Projects
I'm not working on a lot right now, but here are some I'm publicly working on: </br>
