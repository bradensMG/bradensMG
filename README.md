## About me
I'm Braden, and I like making games with LÖVE. I got into text-based programming when I was 13, but it took me a bit to know how to make use of the skill. </br>
- My dominant language is Lua, but I know a little Python and am learning C++ with Raylib. I hope to learn more in the future, like JavaScript!
- I like making music and art. </br>
<p> I've love UNDERTALE, and have for a very long time. I'll develop more original things later on but as I'm getting more into programming, recreating the game is (unfortunately) the best way I've found that helps me to learn more. </p>

## Projects
I'm not working on a lot right now, but here are some I'm publicly working on: </br>
- [DESOLATION](https://gamejolt.com/games/desonee/907634?feed_last_id=%7B%22ver%22:%221%22,%22pos%22:%221719727571.368%22%7D) -- a fangame by sulfuri. <br>
- [UNDERLÖVE](https://github.com/bradensMG/underlove) -- an UNDERTALE battle framework developed by me in LÖVE!
